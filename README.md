# DCE Capstone Project

- Angular app is in the dce-capstone folder, Angular-specific README is in there. 
- Zip file is the Microsoft Power Automate flow. 
- The no-array JSON file is used for the document tagging plugin, as the Doc Gen API does not know how to handle JSON arrays. 
- The sample data JSON is used to pull random questions (a version of this is also in the app)
- The schema file is the same schema used in the Power Automate flow.
